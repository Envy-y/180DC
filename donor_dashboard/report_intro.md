# Data Grouping

To ensure analysis is meaningful, several groups with fewer responses have been grouped. Some examples include:  

- **Age Cohorts**: Derived from Q261–262 and grouped into generational cohorts (Silent, Baby Boomers, Gen X, Millennials, Gen Z)  
- **Education**: Derived from Q275 and collapsed into 4 main categories: Primary or below, Secondary, Tertiary, Postgraduate  
- **Income**: Derived from Q288 household income deciles and grouped into low (1–3), middle (4–7) and high (8–10)

# Survey Area

This map shows the geographic distribution of the WVS respondents. Survey coverage was concentrated in a handful of regions, namely: **Andhra Pradesh, Delhi, Haryana, Punjab, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal**.  

States that were not surveyed are shaded in light grey. One immediate limitation we can see is that this sample is not evenly distributed across India, therefore its findings primarily reflect the states surveyed rather than India as a whole.
